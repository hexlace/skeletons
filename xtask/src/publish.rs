//! `cargo xtask publish-plan <tag>`: work out which crates a publish of
//! `<tag>` uploads, dry-run that publish, and print the plan.
//!
//! The upload itself is not done here, and nothing here ever holds a
//! credential. A dry run compiles every crate it would upload, and each build
//! script and proc macro compiled along the way runs with the environment it
//! was started in. So `.github/workflows/publish.yml` runs this in a job that
//! has no token and cannot mint one, and the job that can then runs
//! `cargo publish --no-verify` with the plan's exclusions, which compiles
//! nothing.
//!
//! Leaving out what crates.io already has is what makes a failed publish safe
//! to run again. `cargo publish --workspace` publishes the members in
//! dependency order and refuses a version crates.io already has, so after a
//! run that published some crates and then failed, a plain re-run would stop
//! at the first of them. This asks crates.io about each crate first and plans
//! to leave out the ones it has.
