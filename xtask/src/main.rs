// `redundant_pub_crate` (clippy nursery) wants `pub` on every item below,
// because a binary's modules are all private. `pub(crate)` is the visibility
// that is actually true, and plain `pub` would trip the workspace's
// `unreachable_pub` instead, so for this whole crate the nursery lint gives way.
